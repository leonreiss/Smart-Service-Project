# Smart Service Project: Predictive Maintenance for Volta Limburg

Project Overview:
- This project aims to improve the efficiency of Volta Limburg's technicians by introducing a machine learning model that classifies heating appliance problems as either customer-solvable or technician-required
- Using ensemble methods such as the random forest algorithm or XGBoost, a data pipeline (decriptives, data cleaning, feature engineering, model training, predicting) was developed and achieving an accuracy of 71.34%
- Impact: The model is designed to reduce unnecessary technician visits, reduce environmental impact through reduced travel and save around €109,000 per year
- The solution is scalable and can easily be expanded to include new data sources, such as Sqippa sensors
- In addition to the model development, ethical, social and business implications were also considered to ensure a sustainable and customer-oriented implementation

Coding Files: 
- The Project consisted of multiple files including descriptive statistics, data cleaning and final model testing. To ensure data privacy, only the file "Volta_Model_testing_Final.Rmd" (R-Markup) with the development of the machine learning models are published here. Furthermore, results and insights, including the final report, are not permitted to be shared here.
